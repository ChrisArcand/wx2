Winds Aloft (Again...)
======================
*D3JS, Flask, Beautiful Soup, Jquery and Sqlite3*

Who it matters for
==================
Well I like to skydive, but anyone who needs to know wind speeds could find some use in this.

Why it is useful
================
The World Meteorological Organization [nomenclature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winds_aloft#Example) specifies that the wind speed, direction, and temperature in a silly way.
I scrape it from their site 4 times daily (when it is updated), parse it, then display it.

Where is this coming from
=========================
[NOAA makes it available here](http://aviationweather.gov/products/nws/winds/?area=chicago&fint=06)

Why are you so bad at javascript?
=================================
Because this is a practice project.
